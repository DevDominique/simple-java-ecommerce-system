# *Simple Java E-commerce System*
This project is a console-based e-commerce system built with Java, showcasing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. Customers can view product details, manage a shopping cart, and check out with a unique order ID. Profiles store customer info and purchase history, while orders are tracked with a "pending" status.



## Features

- 🛒 Shopping cart: add/remove products
- 📦 Checkout with unique order IDs
- 👤 Customer profiles with name, ID, and purchase history
- 📂 Modular package structure (Customer, Product, Order, Main)
- 🎛️ Menu-driven console interface (switch statement)
- 🔄 Robust error handling with exceptions and loops
- ⚙️ Encapsulation via getters/setters for clean data flow
- 💡 Demonstrates practical OOP design patterns
